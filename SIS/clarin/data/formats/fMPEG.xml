  <info type="description" hub="yes">
    <p>MPEG is not a format. It is an "an alliance of working groups established jointly by ISO and IEC that sets standards 
      for media coding, including compression coding of audio, video, graphics, and genomic data; and transmission and 
      file formats for various applications" (Wikipedia). And, of course, it is a heavily underspecified way of talking about various
     audio and video formats, which are too many to group them together.</p>
    <p>In the Standards Information System, MPEG is classified as a "hub format" -- as mentioned at the top of this document. 
        Centres are strongly encouraged to either pick one of the already described "MPEG" varieties (see below), or create a description
        of an MPEG-family format (or suggest that someone else create such a description, by introducing a new ID in the centre's 
        recommendations; first one may wish to check among our "<a href="../views/sanity-check.xq?sortBy=id#missing-form">missing formats</a>" 
      if an appropriate ID has already been suggested).</p> 
    <p>At the time when this description is updated, the following members of the "MPEG family" already have individual descriptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../views/view-format.xq?id=fMPEG1">MPEG-1</a></li>
      <li><a href="../views/view-format.xq?id=fMPEG2">MPEG-2</a></li>
      <li><a href="../views/view-format.xq?id=fMPEG-4-AVC">MPEG-4 AVC</a></li>
      <li><a href="../views/view-format.xq?id=fMP3">MP3</a>, MPEG Audio Layer III</li>
      <li><a href="../views/view-format.xq?id=fMP4">MP4</a>, MPEG-4 File Format, v. 2</li>
    </ul>
